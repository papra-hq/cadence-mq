This guide will show you how to schedule a job to be executed at a specific time.

## Schedule a job at a specific time

You can schedule a job to be executed at a specific time by providing the `scheduledAt` option with a `Date` object:

```ts title="index.ts" collapse={1-12} ins={20-21}
import { createCadence } from '@cadence-mq/core';
import { createMemoryDriver } from '@cadence-mq/driver-memory';

const driver = createMemoryDriver();
const cadence = createCadence({ driver });

cadence.registerTask({
  taskName: 'send-reminder-email',
  handler: async ({ data }) => {
    console.log(`Sending reminder email to ${data.email}`);
  },
});


await cadence.scheduleJob({
  taskName: 'send-reminder-email',
  data: {
    email: 'user@example.com',
  },
  // Schedule job to run at a specific time
  scheduledAt: new Date('2025-05-12'),
});
```

## Schedule a job with a delay

You can also schedule a job to run after a specific delay by adding milliseconds to the current time:

```ts title="index.ts" collapse={1-12} ins={22,14-15}
import { createCadence } from '@cadence-mq/core';
import { createMemoryDriver } from '@cadence-mq/driver-memory';

const driver = createMemoryDriver();
const cadence = createCadence({ driver });

cadence.registerTask({
  taskName: 'send-follow-up-email',
  handler: async ({ data }) => {
    console.log(`Sending follow-up email to ${data.email}`);
  },
});

// Schedule job to run in 1 hour
const oneHourFromNow = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000);

await cadence.scheduleJob({
  taskName: 'send-follow-up-email',
  data: {
    email: 'user@example.com',
  },
  scheduledAt: oneHourFromNow,
});
```

## Important notes

- The `scheduledAt` date must be in the future. If you provide a date in the past, the job will be executed immediately.
- The timezone of the `Date` object will be used for scheduling. Make sure to use the appropriate timezone for your use case. Tip: run you workers process in the same timezone as the process that schedules the jobs.
- Jobs are executed based on the system time of the worker process.
