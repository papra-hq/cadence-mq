The in-memory driver is a driver that stores jobs in memory. It is useful for testing and development or simple single-process applications.

## Installation

The in-memory driver can be installed with the `@cadence-mq/driver-memory` package.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash frame=none
    pnpm add @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-memory
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame=none
    npm install @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-memory
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash frame=none
    bun add @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-memory
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame=none
    yarn add @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-memory
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use the in-memory driver.

import inMemoryDemo from '/../demos/in-memory/index.ts?raw';

<Code lang="ts" code={inMemoryDemo} title="index.ts" collapse="7-100" />

## Limitations

As the job queue is stored in memory, it has the following limitations:

- **No persistence**: The in-memory driver does not persist jobs between restarts.
- **No distributed support**: The in-memory driver does not support multi-process distributed systems.
- **Memory consumption**: As the job queue is stored in memory, it will consume memory as the number of jobs increases, it is recommended to remove jobs that are no longer needed.
