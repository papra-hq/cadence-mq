[LibSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) is a fork of SQLite that is both Open Source, and Open Contributions. It fully compatible with SQLite (either file-based or in-process), but also supports remote LibSQL servers (like [Turso](https://turso.tech/)) for remote and distributed SQLite access.

## Installation

The LibSQL driver can be installed with the `@cadence-mq/driver-libsql` package, and the `@libsql/client` package is required to connect to the database.

    ```bash frame=none
    pnpm add @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-libsql @libsql/client
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame=none
    npm install @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-libsql @libsql/client
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash frame=none
    bun add @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-libsql @libsql/client
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame=none
    yarn add @cadence-mq/core @cadence-mq/driver-libsql @libsql/client
    ```
  </TabItem>

## Setup the schema

In order to use the LibSQL driver, you need to setup the schema for the database. This can be done once at startup, and is done by calling the `setupSchema` function, this function is exported from the `@cadence-mq/driver-libsql` package and will create the necessary tables and indexes for the driver to work, it can be executed just once, and is safe to execute multiple times.

You can also use the `getSchema` function to get the schema as a string, and execute it manually.

import { getSchema } from '@cadence-mq/driver-libsql';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Programmatically">
```ts title="index.ts"
import { setupSchema } from '@cadence-mq/driver-libsql';
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client';

const client = createClient({ /**/ });

// Setup the schema
await setupSchema({ client });
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Manually">
    <Code lang="sql" code={getSchema()} title="schema.sql" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Local SQLite file example

Here is a simple example of how to use the LibSQL driver to store jobs in a local SQLite file.

import libSqlDemoLocalFile from '/../demos/libsql-local-file/index.ts?raw';

<Code lang="ts" code={libSqlDemoLocalFile} title="index.ts" collapse="14-100" />

## Remote LibSQL server example

Here is a simple example of how to use the LibSQL driver to store jobs in a remote LibSQL server.

import libSqlDemoRemoteServer from '/../demos/libsql-remote-server/index.ts?raw';

<Code lang="ts" code={libSqlDemoRemoteServer} title="index.ts" collapse="17-100" />

## In-process example

Here is a simple example of how to use the LibSQL driver to store jobs in-process, this is useful for testing and development. For a lower overhead, you can use the [in-memory driver](/drivers/memory-driver) instead.

import libSqlDemoMemory from '/../demos/libsql-memory/index.ts?raw';

<Code lang="ts" code={libSqlDemoMemory} title="index.ts" collapse="12-100" />

<Aside type="note">
  As for the [in-memory driver](/drivers/memory-driver), using the LibSQL driver with an `:memory:` comes with some limitations: no persistence, no distributed support, and memory consumption, more details in the [in-memory driver](/drivers/memory-driver#limitations) documentation.
