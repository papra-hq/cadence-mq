CadenceMQ is a job scheduling library like BullMQ or Agenda but designed to be backend-agnostic and not tied to a storage layer (unlike BullMQ with Redis or Agenda with MongoDB). Users can plug in a driver to use a specific backend.

## The monorepo

The source code is organized in a pnpm-workspace monorepo, available on GitHub: `papra-hq/cadence-mq`.

- The core functionality is under `packages/core`
- Drivers are defined under `packages/driver-<name>`
- There are test suites defined in the `packages/test-suite` package to help testing the drivers
- There is a Markdown based documentation website made with astro starlight in the `docs` package
- There is some demo snippets in the `demo` package

## Code style

* Prefer functional programming
* Embrace dependency injection to make the code testable
* In test files, prefer dependency injectionâ€“friendly snippets over magic mocks
